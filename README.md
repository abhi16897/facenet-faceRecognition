## How to use

To install all the requirements for the project run

	Python 3.6.x - 64 bit
	
	pip install -r requirements.txt

In the root directory. After the modules have been installed you can run the project by using python

	python facenet.py


We are using the Windows 10 Text-to-Speech library to output our audio message, so if you want to run it on a different OS then you will have to replace the speech library used in facenet.py
